=head1 The Swim Informational Model

Swim defines an information model for text documents. The 2 main generic
components are I<blocks> and I<phrases>. This pretty directly corresponds to
the HTML concepts of I<divs> and I<spans>.

The model is roughly expressed by this grammar:

    # A document is a set of blocks
    document: block*
    # A block is /either/ a set of more blocks /or/ a set of phrases
    block: block* | phrase*
    # A phrase is moer or less a sentence fragement
    phrase: bold | italic | link | â€¦ | plain-text

Swim is literally defined by this grammar:
